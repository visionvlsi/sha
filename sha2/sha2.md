<ul>
<li>SHA-2 includes significant changes from its predecessor, SHA-1.</li>
<li>The SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with digests (hash values) that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits;
  SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256.</li>
<li>SHA-256 and SHA-512 are novel hash functions computed with eight 32-bit and 64-bit words, respectively. They use different shift amounts and additive constants, but their structures are otherwise virtually identical, differing only in the number of rounds.</li>
<li>SHA-224 and SHA-384 are truncated versions of SHA-256 and SHA-512 respectively, computed with different initial values.</li>
<li>SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are also truncated versions of SHA-512, but the initial values are generated using the method described in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) PUB 180-4.</li></ul>
